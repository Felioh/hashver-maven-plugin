How to release:

        mvn clean
        mvn -Prelease,ossrh release:prepare
        mvn -Prelease,ossrh release:perform

        git push --tags
        git push origin master

    I use PGP key C49AF0DB403D65030CF27C61041434A8F48149F3
    which was published to keys.openpgp.org.

    If something goes wrong:

        git reset â€“hard HEAD~1 (You may have to do it a second time,
                                depending upon when the error occurred.)
        git tag -d tagName
        git push origin :refs/tags/tagName
